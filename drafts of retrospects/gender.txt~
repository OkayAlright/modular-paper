#Gender

I wish I were a woman.
Every day that I look at my body I think that.
I have thought that since I was a kid, but I never told
anyone because I already felt like my connection with
those around me was strained enough. I didn't want to
stress those ties anymore than they already were.

I played with barbies as a kid. My mothers father
wasn't very happy abou that fact. A few other people
in my non-immediate family took objection to it as well.
I didn't know about it then. Or maybe I just forgot.

My mother wondered if I was asexual growing up.
I dated someone briefly in my freshman year of
highschool. I could never really talk to girls in a
calm manner. Not just because of the awkwardness
of teenage years (though I am sure that didn't help),
but because I was made so keenly aware of what I was
not when I spoke to them: a girl. What I felt
during over those those years is what I can only
describe as a lighting-depression

I never wallowed in deep depression for weeks or
months like my bipolar had me do. But when I looked
in a mirror, began to undress, or sat in a doctors office,
it would strike.

The creaking of my knees feel louder.
I would get a cold snap up my lower back. My hands
would feel heavier. My skin looked blochier.
I would be depressed until something happened to take
my mind to other things.

I still think about it frequently, (not) being a woman.
Though I dressed "clash" for a little while, that didn't
feel right to me. And my build and my height are far
too masculine to pull off androgyny.

So I dress in clothes that fit me and are comfortable,
as to try and bring as little (self) attention to my
body as possible. I still get into funks about it though.
Coding as proven helpful in distracting me when I do.

I once told my mom that if I had the choice to be born
again but as a woman, I would take it. I still stand by that
statement.
