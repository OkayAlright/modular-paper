I have never seen death. I have someone dying and I have
seen someone dead, but never the moment in between the
two. But what is described as a "look in their eyes," or a
"sound of a resigned sigh" that tells you that they realize
they are about to die is something I have never witnessed.

The earliest person I can remember that I saw dying was
my grandmother. I was too young to know what the
bandanna on her head meant, but I knew it wasn't good.
She is also the earliest person I saw dead, I believe. I don't
remember much from the few years following her death.

What I do remember is that I typically have a delayed
response when I find out someone had died. For a day or
two after the news I am sad, but after a short time i move
into a deeper stage of mourning. I'll fall into bouts of
crying for a few minutes and then be fine for the next few
hours. There are only two deaths I can remember crying
immediately after: my aforementioned grandmother and
her husband, my grandfather.

My grandfathers death was particularly strange in that it
was the day before my other grandmothers birthday.
Though a cried when I heard he died, I sobbed when I
wished my grandmother a happy birthday the next day.
She cried with me.

My mothers side of the family talks about death plainly.
We talk about those who passed. We talk about those who
are passing. We talk about our own death as well. It is
never sad, typically it has a gallows-humor tone to it. To
my fathers family death is a topic to be discussed
amongst the men behind a closed door. Never should you
speak of it at near the dinner table.

I have never cared to give death much of a thought past
the brief, honest evaluation of possibility before I do
something stupid. I have talked about my death in front
of family members, to mixed response. It is because I am
too young, not because of what I say, which surprises me.
What reasonable thing could I say about it? I know
nothing on the subject. I have never seen death.
