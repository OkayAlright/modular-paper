My first memory of my colorblindness was in preschool.
We were playing a game to learn the names of different colors
by sorting bears into piles. The bears were red, blue, green, yellow,
and purple. My kind of colorblindness allows me to see red and green
if they are the only colors on an object, but if they are mixed with
anything else (such as blue, in the case of purple) I see the
secondary color only.

I made my piles, the four that I could distinguish (red, blue, green,
and yellow), and I presented it to my teacher. She told me that it
was wrong and to try it again. I went back and couldn't
figure out what I had done wrong. After repeatedly saying that it
was right, the teacher helped me. She separated my blue pile into
two groups. For the life of me I could not figure out what she was
doing. She said "these ones are blue and these ones are purple."
I thought  she was lying and making fun of me so I cried. I was
roughly three years old.

Colorblindness was been one of my two longest standing sore points
(only comparable to someone making fun of when I stutter).  I think it
is because the jokes made about it are jokes I can never be "in on."
When someone makes fun of dyslexia, I can get it because I have the
ability to read correctly; i know the contrast that creates the
joke. If someone makes fun of me not being able to see green, I can
never find the humor. Color is akin to a mathematical definition to
me: I know that purple is green mixed with red, but it is not
something that naturally occurs to me, only an idea. Since it is
impossible to just imagine a new color, it just lives in the words of
its definition.

Given my inability to really engage with color, it was never a large
part of my process. I never really liked coloring books once I found
out I was colorblind. I never really used things like sticky notes for
organization. My memories are never really in color unless an items
color has great importance to the event I am remembering.

One of the more recent problems I have run into is syntax highlighting
when writing code. Programs that assist programmers often color text
differently base on what they types. Variables may be one color while
function definitions might be another. This highlighting has no effect
on my and I often don't turn it on if it is off by default. When
programming with other people it can become cumbersome for them to
look at code on my computer because it becomes this wall of black and
white colors. There is absolutely no visual assistance for them to
break up the syntax. Considering the inverse, some popular color
schemes make it entirely impossible for me to see certain kinds of
words. If someone is using a blue background (common in the very
popular "cobalt" editor scheme) and some word is colored purple, there
is no chance in hell I will be able to see it.

I came to acquire Enchroma glasses within the last year. They are
supposed to assist in correcting colorblindness. They won't totally fix it,
just lessen the blindness. They work. I got to see purple for the
first time in my life when a friend googled it and turned the computer
screen to me as I put them on for the first time. It was totally
overwhelming. I have only worn them a handful of times. It isn't just
like correcting a lisp or stutter. It isn't like improving your
ability to consistently identify words. It is the process of unveiling
something that was totally out of your grasp for the majority of your
life. Taking things you have known for years and making you aware of
an aspect you have been so plainly and fundamentally missing. I spent
four or five hours just staring at things in my room one day. Photos
of family, small wooden boxes, and notes from my god daughter looked
alien in through those lenses. They were covered in colors I had never
seen before. They didn't feel like they were mine.

I don't wear the glasses in my house anymore.
