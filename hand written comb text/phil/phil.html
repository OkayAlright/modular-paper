	<p><div id='shuffle1'>You walked in and wouldn't introduce yourself. Neck craned forward and hands uncomfortably pressed 
	against your sides like you were mimicking a tall bird. We couldn't stop staring at your bowl cut. 
	I am sorry.</div></p>

	<p><div id='shuffle2'>You wanted us to call you Phil and you wanted us to laugh. Never once did we not laugh at a joke of 
	yours, unless you were laughing to much at it to get to the punch line. You seemed addicted to 
	laughter, both yours and others.</div> I will always remember, clear as day, when you walked to the back 
	of a quiet classroom and poured yourself water:</p>

        <p>"Phillip is filling up his cup."</p>

	<p><div id='shuffle3'>You laughed hard enough that you needed an inhale. We looked at you like you were a freak. You were a freak. 
	We were all freaks. Elijah couldn't focus, Bradley threw chairs, Andy couldn't add, I couldn't read, and 
	you tried to kill yourself. We didn't know that until later. </div></p>



	<p><div id='shuffle4'>You left for district. You left us in Center. We didn't talk for years. I got updates periodically through 
	Bradley, but he was too strung out to recall what clean clothes looked like most of the time, or maybe his 
	parents missed a water bill. I don't know. But he left soon after you did, so I lost all contact with you. 
	I am sorry.</div> </p>

	<p><div id='shuffle5'>What happened? How did you choose to become an engineer? Where did you go to school? Why did you go to that 
	specific school? I don't know. I won't know. Why should I know? You left and I stayed. You made it out. 
	You made it out. You made it out.</div></p>

	<p><div id='shuffle6'>What the fuck does that even mean? Abdulai went to prison, Nafees is peddling shit, Jacob went in and out 
	of programs for addiction, and you died. Why did we want to get out?</div></p>

	<p><div id='shuffle7'>You were told to get out enough by teachers. You would interrupt a class with a joke or do something stupid 
	and Mr Z. would yell "PHIL." You would turn to him with a blank stare of confusion and then throw another
	pencil into a spinning ceiling fan because you were bored.</div></p>

	<p><div id='shuffle8'>You were always bored. You never had enough work to do. Anything we were assigned you would have done before 
	teacher finished explaining the prompt, so you often did the wrong thing. You didn't redo it though, you 
	already did work.</div></p>


	<p><div class="blockout">My parents still have the picture of us from seventh grade. The picture where you stepped forward right before 
	it was taken. You did it to look taller than the rest of us; you just looked out of place.  Sometimes people 
	say "I can't picture them as an adult" when young people die. I think you were always out of place. 
	I am sorry.</div></p>
