	  <p>
	  I just want to go to sleep. My head hurts.<br/>
	  </p> 
	  <p>
	  <span id="switch1">We have to learn cursive</span>. The teacher says it<br/>
	  is something everyone needs to learn, it's<br/>
	  just what you do. I can't read cursive...<br/>
	  well, I can't properly read print either,<br/>
	  but I really can't cursive. I have spent the last<br/>
	  thirty minutes writing fifty lower case "a"s. Then<br/>
	  I get to spend thirty more minutes writing fifty lower<br/>
	  case "b"s...then I get to do it with the next 24 letters.<br/>
	  Oh, wait, then it's uppercase. I am <span id="switch2">going to be up all<br/>
	  night doing</span> this.<br/>
	  </p> 
	  <p>
	  <span id="switch3">Who came up with the cursive letter for uppercase "G"s? What<br/>
	  is wrong with them?</span><br/>
	  </p> 
	  <p>
	  Why am I not learning how to read?  Why <span
	id="switch4">am I spending</span> time learning<br/>
	  an entirely new and even more confusing way to write a language that<br/>
	  I already struggle with? <span id="switch5">Why are they</span> doing this?<br/>
	  </p> 
	  <p>
	  <span id="switch6">I want to cry.</span>
