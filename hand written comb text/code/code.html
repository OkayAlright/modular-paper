        <p> It's one in the morning on a Tuesday. I have class tomorrow and I cannot even finish the first assignment.
        All my program has to do is display "Hello, world." Instead I am staring at black screen with a small sentence in
        harsh white text:</p>

       <p>"What the fuck did I get myself into..." </p>

       <p>  I don't get it. I am supposed to just write "print" before "Hello, World." But how do I run the program?
        Why does that work? <span id="switch1">I really spent eleven years reading nonsense words to figure out how to spell to get stuck on this.</span></p>

        <p id="switch2"> Maybe they were right, I am going to be a gas station attendent. They told me otherwise, but I know.</p>

        <p>No, no, no. <span id="switch3">I can figure this out</span>. Let me look at the class notes.</p>
    <p>
    <div id="shuffle1">
    # This file is hello.py - a first short program in python.
    </div>
    <div id="shuffle4">
    print "Hello world"
    </div>
    <div id="shuffle5">
    $ python hello.py
    </div>
    <div id="shuffle6">
    Hello world!
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>I am absolutely fucked.</p>

    <p id="switch4">I mean, I know I didn't do much reading in highschool nor did I do very much math, but this should be simple. Maybe this is why Mr. O said he couldn't teach me programming, he never was able to learn.</p>

    <p>What am I going to tell <span id="switch5">Jim</span>. I just got to college and I am already hitting a wall.</p>

    <p id="switch6">I am no better than I was.</p>

    <p>Let me try this again:
<div class="blockout">
    <p>>>> print "Hello world."<br>
    Hello, world</p>

</div>    
 <p id="switch7">Wait, it worked...it actually worked. Let me try it again.</p>
<p>
<div id="shuffle2">
    $ Print "Hello world."
</div>
<div id="shuffle3">
    NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
</div>
</p>

 <p id="switch8">Fuck, why didn't that work.</p>
	
        </div>
