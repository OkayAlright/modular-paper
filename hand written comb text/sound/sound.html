	  I don't <span id="switch1">get</span> music. It is <span id="switch2">overwhelming</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The worst is during holidays. With all of my <br /> 
	  loud aunts and uncles speaking, I already get <br /> 
	  a head ache, but music just adds mud to the air. <br /> 
	  I can't <span id="switch3">think straight</span>. <br /> 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  It feels a lot like reading. I look at a page <br /> 
	  and <span id="shuffle1">the text starts to move</span>, I cannot <br /> 
	  tell the words apart. Sound is the same way. I <br /> 
	  <span id="switch4">get lost in</span> the wall of noise.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  My sister likes music, she also likes the city. <br /> 
	  I get too flustered by it, though I like skyscrapers. <br /> 
	  I want to be an <span id="switch5">architect</span> when I am <br /> 
	  older. Buildings make sense, noise doesn't. <br /> 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Architecture is a system, there are parts to put together <br /> 
	  and if they go up in the wrong order, <br /> 
	  <span id="switch6">it does't work</span>. Sound can be in <br /> 
	  any order you want it to be. A <span id="switch7">car horn</span> <br /> 
	  here and there, some <span id="switch8">yelling</span> in the distance <br /> 
	  sprinkled throughout. Sound doesn't make sense. <br /> 
	  </p>  
	  <p>
	  Music is just sound that has been rained in. <br /> 
	  It can sound like it is about to end but then <br /> 
	  it just gets louder. <br /> 
	  </p>  
	  <p>
	  I can turn away from text. <span id="switch9">Music</span> <br /> 
	  is surrounding <span id="switch10">you</span> all the time. <br /> 
	  </p>
